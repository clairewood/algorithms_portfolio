Portfolio project for my Intro to Algorithms class. 

Prompt for assignment: <br>

You are given a 2-D puzzle of size MxN, that has N rows and M column (M and N can be different). Each cell in the puzzle is either empty or has a barrier. An empty cell is marked by ‘-’ (hyphen) and the one with a barrier is marked by ‘#’. You are given two coordinates from the puzzle (a,b) and (x,y). You are currently located at (a,b) and want to reach (x,y). You can move only in the following directions. <br>
L: move to left cell from the current cell<br>
R: move to right cell from the current cell<br>
U: move to upper cell from the current cell<br>
D: move to the lower cell from the current cell <br>

You can move to only an empty cell and cannot move to a cell with a barrier in it. Your goal is to reach the destination cells covering the minimum number of cells as you travel from the starting cell.
